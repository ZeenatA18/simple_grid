                            It was established in 1994.
                            The museum is reminiscent of the once vibrant multi-ethnic areas that were forcibly removed
                            during apartheid in the 1960s and 1970s.
                            The area of ​​District 6 is partially divided into the suburbs of Walmer Estate, Sonnebloom,
                            and Lower Blade, the rest of which is generally undeveloped land.
